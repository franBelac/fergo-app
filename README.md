## FerGO
# Application for indoor rowing events

# Installation

 Open the project as maven project.
 Run
 ```mvn clean package```.
 Two JAR files are now created in the target folder
 You need the one that includes the JavaFX dependencies (~30Mb).
 Out of the box, it is called `FerGO-v1-jar-with-dependencies.jar` but
 you can change that in the pom.xml. Works on all operating systems,
 all you need is java 17 :)
